        description: I worked for almost a year as a research assistant under the guidance of <a href="https://sharif.edu/~izadi/">Dr. Mohammad Izadi</a> and as a member of the Distributed and Multi-agent Systems Lab. We worked on WIDESim, a simulation tool for resource management and scheduling of workflows in distributed computing environments with graph topology. This tool was built upon the well-known <a href="https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim">CloudSim</a> simulator. The development is finished, and we finished the work on the paper recently.
